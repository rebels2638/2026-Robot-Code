# WPILib Agent Tools Scoped Rule

- Before running simulation in a sandbox, confirm how the repo switches between simulation and IRL modes.
- Check `Constants.java` first, then other mode-routing code (mode enums, `RobotContainer` wiring, build flags) to ensure the correct mode is active for simulation and change if needed.
- Use sandbox execution for iterative simulation testing and verification — simple, non-iterative changes can be made directly in the workspace.
- Keep direct workspace edits for final reviewed patches only, after explicit approval.
