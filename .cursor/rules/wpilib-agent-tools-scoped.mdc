# WPILib Agent Tools Scoped Rule

- For robot code changes, prefer sandbox execution and verification before workspace updates.
- Confirm how the repo switches between simulation and IRL modes before editing behavior.
- Check `Constants.java` first, then other mode-routing code (mode enums, `RobotContainer` wiring, build flags) as needed.
- Before executing sim/robot workflows, stop older runs so only one instance is active.
- Run simulation and analysis from a sandbox context whenever possible.
- Keep direct workspace edits for final reviewed patches only, after explicit approval.
- After patch generation, clean completed sandboxes with `wpilib-agent-tools sandbox clean --name <id>` unless the user asks to keep them.
